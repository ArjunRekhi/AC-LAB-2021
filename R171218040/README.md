# Application Containerisation Lab

### Container platform

It can be defined as a technology to isolate processes from each other in such a manner that processes run like they are running in a normal operating system
which is enforced by the container runtime. They ideally share the resources of a single host machine without having the ability to see each other’s or the host’s 
processes and resources because of namespaces and cgroups. A platform also has a control over the runtime and the lifecycle of the images.
It can also be defined as a tool or technology, which provides the functionality to spin up containers with the extraction at the software level and not at the hardware 
level like virtual Machines.

**Examples:** LXC, Rkt, Docker.

**In this repository, I have attached some experiments and their procedure**
